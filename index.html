      <p>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania. 
        Through this program, I have gained experience in various areas of data analysis, including machine learning, data visualization, and statistical modeling. My coursework has also exposed me to a variety of programming languages and tools, such as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and contribute to the field of data science.</p>
